Merkwood is a tokenization service for artists and content creators.

A content creator might use Merkwood to instantiate a **_Bard_**--an ERC1155 multi-token standard contract--in an effort to more substantively control the distribution of their work. There is also an opportunity to better engage with fans by selling direct-to-consumer. Artists using Merkwood can sleep well knowing that their work is scarce and no longer infinitely replicable.

Additionally, there is an associated DAO, AuthorDAO, for Merkwood users to work together. Each member can proportionally participate in the governance of services such as a distributed content distribution platform.
