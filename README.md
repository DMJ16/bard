Merkwood is a tokenization service for artists and content creators to wrap their art for sale.

## 🌲🍄🌳

Merkwood is a reference to Tolkien's magical forest **_Mirkwood_**, but with the "i" swapped with "e" as a nod to the Merkle Patricia Tree.

## 🔏

A content creator might use Merkwood to instantiate a **_Bard_**--an ERC1155 multi-token standard contract--in an effort to more substantively control the distribution of their work. Through tokenization, artists can sleep well knowing that their work is scarce and no longer infinitely replicable.

There is also an opportunity to better engage with fans by selling direct-to-consumer.

Additionally, there is a proof-of-concept Rinkeby testnet DAO--AuthorDAO. Each member could proportionally participate in the governance of a service such as a distributed content distribution platform.
